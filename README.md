# Musiverse Backend

Welcome to the Musiverse Backend repository! This project is designed to power the backend functionality of a music streaming platform, providing essential modules for user management, song management, playlist creation, and thumbnail handling. Below is a brief overview of each module:

## 1. User Module

The User Module defines the structure of user information within the system. It includes attributes such as first name, last name, email, password, and username. This module enforces rules for user signup, ensuring that required fields are provided. Additionally, it facilitates user authentication by verifying login credentials against the user table.

## 2. Song Module

The Song Module allows users to add songs to the platform's music library. It captures details like song title, image, audio file, and duration. Each song is associated with its respective creator through a user reference. This module forms the backbone for song management, enabling functionalities like creation, editing, and searching within the application while maintaining data integrity.

## 3. Playlist Module

The Playlist Module empowers users to create and customize their own playlists. Users can specify a name and image for each playlist and add references to songs. This module plays a crucial role in managing the music library within the application, enabling users to curate their music collections by creating playlists containing their favorite songs and associating them with their user accounts.

## 4. Image Module

The Image Module is responsible for managing image files within the application. It stores essential information about each image, including its name, storage location, and creation timestamp. This functionality enhances the application's image upload capabilities, allowing for efficient organization and retrieval of images.
